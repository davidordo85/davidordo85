## Education and Training:

- Python BootCamp KeepCoding from scratch, where I acquired solid knowledge in object-oriented programming, web development with Python (using frameworks like Django or Flask), desktop application development with graphical interfaces using Tkinter, and game development using the Pygame library.

- Web BootCamp KeepCoding, where I gained in-depth knowledge of the most current and popular web technologies. During the BootCamp KeepCoding, I focused on both client-side and server-side development.

  In the frontend development field, I have extensive knowledge of HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, including frameworks and libraries like React and Redux. I have used these technologies to build interactive and dynamic user interfaces, single-page applications, and efficient application state management.

  In terms of backend development, I have experience with Node.js and Express.js, which has allowed me to create robust and scalable web servers. I have also worked with both SQL and MongoDB databases, giving me the ability to design and manage efficient databases and perform complex queries.

  Additionally, I have knowledge in implementing authentication and authorization, integrating external APIs, optimizing web application performance, and ensuring their security.

In summary, during the web BootCamp KeepCoding, I acquired solid skills in frontend and backend development, as well as database management and the implementation of advanced features in web applications.

I continue to expand my knowledge and skills through online courses, books, and active participation in the development community.
